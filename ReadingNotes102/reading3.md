Class 3 Reading Notes

Since I am on a Mac, this introduction Revision and the Cloud, explaining Git, recommends that I have a solid understanding of Terminal (Windows and Linux users would be needing an understanding of Command Line); although I only have a beginner to intermediary understanding of Terminal, I  nonetheless will be able to relay the information from a relatively non-technical perspective of someone who is interested in learning more. The Terminal (or Command Line) function as remote repositories for collaborations on Git projects.

Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). From a historical perspective of Version Control Systems, there has a been a progression from Local Version Control on one database, to   a more collaborative Centralized Version Control System (which was vulnerable to loss of access and data if the central server failed), to Distributed Version Control Systems (which are able to allow teams of programmers to create data backups called multiple mirrored repositories, which can easily replace any lost information on a central server).

To track and stage new files a a-c-p system; 
which essentially refers to adding-committing-pushing changes from a local “master” branch to a remote “origin” repository (reflecting this is the command “git push origin master”.
Additionally, one can use the command “git stash” to temporarily  hide and save uncommitted changes and the command “git stash apply” to later retrieve these hidden changes.
