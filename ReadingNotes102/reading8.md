JavaScript uses **assignment operators** and **comparison operators** to create 
**loops** with *for statements* and *while statements*. 

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. For statements are often used to create loops with a counting of iterations, comparing the number of attempts relative to preestablished pramaters. While statements continue to repeat until a condition has been met.
