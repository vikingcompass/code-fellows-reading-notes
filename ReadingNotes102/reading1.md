# Reading Notes 1 Learning Markdown 

At this 102 level, with this week being the first time that I have every been introduced to Markdown, I am dependent on Markdown Cheat Sheets to know what to do. Since this is the first week that I have every been introduced to HTML as well, I don't fully appreciate the added simplicity Markdown brings relative to HTML Semantics. I am sensing that I will increasingly appreciate the evolution of coding language advances as I progress through the initial three weeks of 201. 

Thie Growth Mindset at this stage of my learning will help me focus on effort producing gains, persisting through obstacles (rather that losing focus), and embracing challenges.
